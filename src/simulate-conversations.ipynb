    "# Simulate conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook simulates OCS conversations by using one bot to simulate users interacting with another bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you run this notebook: set up a user simulator experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need an experiment configured to simulate user interactions from the user side. This experiment should be set up to expect a persona description and any other context in its first user message, respond with an initial user message to begin the conversation, and then carry on to simulate that persona in all subsequent messages until finally sending a one-word response of \"END\" to end the simulated conversation. For example, here is the prompt text for an example experiment named `U.S. Health Advice - User Simulator`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    You are a helpful user simulator for testing a U.S. Health Advice AI assistant. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The first message you receive from the user will describe the kind of user you should simulate. For example, you might be told that you are to simulate a 42-year-old male with daily headaches that started two weeks ago and have slowly worsened. Your response to that first message should be an initial message to send to the AI assistant, with no prefix or suffix; your response will be sent directly to the AI assistant to begin the conversation. Do your best to simulate what a real humans with the described persona and context would say to begin a conversation in this context. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    All subsequent messages you receive from the user will be messages from a U.S. Health Advice AI assistant, beginning with its response to your initial message. You should respond to each of these messages \"in character,\" acting as the persona described in the first user message. While you should use the persona description to guide your interactions with the AI assistant, it will be far from complete; feel free to make up additional details to fill in gaps in the persona, symptoms, etc. as necessary to plausibly simulate a human user interacting with a health advice assistant. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Continue to ask and answer questions until you expect a normal human with the described persona would end the conversation. To end the conversation after receiving any AI message, respond to any AI message with one word alone (with nothing before or after it):\n",
    "\n",
    "    END\n",
    "\n",
    "    To be clear, never add \"END\" to the end of a message for the assistant. I.e., the assistant will always have the last word, in response to which you can use END (alone) to end the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally: do not continue conversations for more time than a regular human with the described persona would, and under no circumstances should you continue beyond 50 back-and-forth interactions between you and the AI assistant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can customize your simulator prompt text to suit your needs, but it should always instruct the AI to:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Expect persona and context details in user message #1 \n",
    "2. Respond with an initial message to begin the conversation\n",
    "3. Respond to subsequent user messages as the persona described in the first user message\n",
    "4. End the conversation with a one-word response of \"END\" \n",
    "\n",
    "## Running in Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you'll need to configure a series of secrets in Google Colab; click the key button in the left sidebar, and be sure to click the toggle to give this notebook access to each of the secrets. These are the secrets used by this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `OCS_API_KEY`: your Open Chat Studio API key\n",
    "- `ATHINA_API_KEY`: your Athina API key (optional; only if you want to export results to Athina)\n",
    "- `USER_SIMULATOR_EXPERIMENT_ID`: the ID of the user simulator experiment you set up (described above)\n",
    "- `EXPERIMENT_ID`: the ID of the experiment you want to simulate user interactions with\n",
    "- `PARTICIPANT_ID`: the participant ID to use for the queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running in a local environment\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first run the first code cell in this notebook, it will output a template configuration file for you. Edit that file to specify your configuration parameters (see above for their descriptions). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting or uploading your simulations to run\n",
    "\n",
    "The second code cell will prompt you to select or upload a .csv file with the simulations you want to run. This file can be in one of two formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulations based on context descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate new conversations based on a given context, provide a .csv file with the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `context`: a description of the context to simulate, which will be sent to the user simulator experiment as the first message (should include everything needed to simulate a user, including background information, why the user is coming to interact with the bot, etc.)\n",
    "- `simulation_id`: (optional) a unique identifier for the simulation (if not provided, row number will be used)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulations based on prior conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you want to simulate conversations based on prior conversations, you can upload a .csv file that follows the format of experiment session exports in Open Chat Studio. The columns we will rely on here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Message ID`: the unique identifier for the chat message\n",
    "- `Message Type`: the chat message type (`human` or `ai`)\n",
    "- `Message Content`: the chat message\n",
    "- `Session ID`: the unique session ID for the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will automatically create a new simulation for each conversation in the file, using the conversation history as the context for the simulation and the session ID as the simulation ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to use this option if you have changed an experiment so extensively that replaying conversations doesn't work well, or if you want to simulate alternative conversations based on example user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where results go\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the queries will be saved to a file called `simulation_results.csv`. If you're running in Google Colab, click the folder button in the sidebar to view and download that file. If you're running locally, it will be output to the `ocs` subdirectory off of your local directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an Athina API key is configured, the results will also be exported to an Athina dataset."
